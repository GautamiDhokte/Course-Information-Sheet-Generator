Course Assessment Generator is an application which helps teachers to generate course assessment report after completion 
of each course automatically rather than manually. This report helps to check whether the targeted result for that course
in that year is achieved or not. Depending on the outcome, if target is not achieved than need to specify reason for it 
and then provide an action plan to achieve in the target in subsequent years.
